List of Changes to be made to migrate to and fro between Development and Production:

1) Backend:
    1.1) ./app.js
        - app.use(cors()) -> Change address as required
    1.2) ./.env 
        - Switch between Dev and Server URL (Not necessary during deployment as env variables are handled seperately)

2) Admin:
    2.1) ./api/client.js
        - Switch between Dev and Server Axios client
